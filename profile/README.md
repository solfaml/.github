SolfaML is a markup language for composing Solfège or Solfa pieces in a compact format, designed with extensible tooling in mind.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is still in development, more details and updates will be added over time.

## Projects

The SolfaML ecosystem is composed by the following tools:

- [solfaml-parser](https://github.com/solfaml/solfaml-parser): A parser written in Rust designed for cross-language use.
- solfaml-cli: A command line application for generating PNG or PDF files from SolfaML files. **(TODO)**
- solfaml-studio: A web-based playground for editing and previewing SolfaML compositions. **(TODO)**

## Contributions

The project is still at its earliest stage of development, but contributions and feedbacks are welcome.
